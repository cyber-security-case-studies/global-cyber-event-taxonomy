# Global Cyber Event Taxonomy
The Global Cyber Event Taxonomy ("GCET") is an open-source taxonomy for classifying key attributes of cyber security events that have occurred worldwide.

It is owned and maintained by [Cyber Security Case Studies](https://www.cybersecuritycasestudies.com/) and released as an open-source resource under the [GNU GPL v3](LICENSE).

The taxonomy has been iteratively developed through the analysis of thousands of highly-detailed cyber security case studies. [Further information on the taxonomy can be found here](https://www.cybersecuritycasestudies.com/global-cyber-event-taxonomy).

## Development
This repository contains both [JSON](gcet.json) and [XML](gcet.xml) versions of the GCET. New versions will be released periodically as new classifications are incorporated.

Major structual changes will first be proposed as a pull request and if there's no public objections within 30 calendar days, will be merged into the master branch.

Any feedback, thoughts, additions or modifications are welcomed and should be submitted either using the [Issues](https://github.com/cyber-security-case-studies/global-cyber-event-taxonomy/issues) tab above or through submitting a [pull request](https://github.com/cyber-security-case-studies/global-cyber-event-taxonomy/pulls)

## Visualised
