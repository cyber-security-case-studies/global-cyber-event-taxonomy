# Global Cyber Event Taxonomy
The Global Cyber Event Taxonomy ("GCET") is an open-source taxonomy for classifying key attributes of cyber security events that have occurred worldwide.

It is owned and maintained by [Cyber Security Case Studies](https://www.cybersecuritycasestudies.com/) and released as an open-source resource under the GNU GPL v3.

The taxonomy has been iteratively developed from over 3,000 global cyber security events. [Further information can be found here](https://www.cybersecuritycasestudies.com/global-cyber-event-taxonomy).

## Overview
This repository contains both JSON and XML versions of the GCET. New version will be released periodically as new classifications are incorporated.

Major structual changes will first be proposed as a pull request and if there's no objections within 30 calendar days, will be merged into the master branch.

Any feedback, thoughts, additions or modifications are welcomed and should be submitted either using the [Issues](/issues) tab above or through submitting a [pull request](/pulls)

A visual representation of the taxonomy using the [Radial Tidy Tree visualisation from the D3 library](https://github.com/d3/d3) can be viewed below (**Note:** This may not necessarily incorporate the most recent data)
